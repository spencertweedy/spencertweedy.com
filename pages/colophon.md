Gradually improving this website is like a [worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/). I come back to it when I want to soothe myself with something comprehensible, puzzle-like, and expressive.

I develop it “by hand” because it’s fun and because I want the cottage industry of the web to continue. The commercial internet has consolidated so much influence in the hands of so few. With open-source tools, small-tech businesses, and personal websites, we can foster more constructive applications of the internet.

My website’s underlying code and more information about the technologies it uses are on [GitHub](https://github.com/spencertweedy/spencertweedy.com).

The typesetting is in flux. Right now the site is set in Times New Roman, your browser’s default sans-serif font, and [ISO](https://www.scribbletone.com/typefaces/iso) by Scribble Tone. The drum icon is by [Arthur Shlain](https://thenounproject.com/icon/drum-135575/) via The Noun Project.

[Many people]({% link pages/i-like.html %}) have inspired and informed me on this journey of homegrown website cooking, which I began as a teen in the late aughts.
