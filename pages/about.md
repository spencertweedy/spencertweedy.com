I’m a drummer and a writer in Chicago. Some people call me Spoon. I make [music]({% link pages/releases/releases.html %}) with my family, my friends, and strangers who ask.

I also co-own [The Pocket](https://pocketchicago.com/), a recording studio, with Jason Ashworth, and co-organize [Avrom Farm Party](https://avromfarmparty.com/), a small music festival. In 2020, I co-created [*Mirror Sound*]({% link pages/mirror-sound.html %}), a book about musicians who self-record.

I made a playlist of [50 songs I dram](https://lnkfi.re/50dram) so you can check out some of the records I’ve worked on.

You can [subscribe to my newsletter]({{ site.subscribe_url }}). And you can <a href="{% link pages/contact.md %}">contact me</a>.

Thanks for being here.
