I’m a drummer and a writer in Chicago.

Some people call me Spoon.

I love to [record]({% link pages/releases/releases.html %}) and [tour]({% link pages/shows/shows.html %}).

And I love writing on the internet.

## Special Projects, Hare-Brained Schemes, and Failed (?) Experiments

**Observations books.** In 2018, I started a [daily blog]({% link pages/observations/index.html %}) about interesting things and people I encountered out in the world. I published at least one item on it every day until 2023, when I stopped liking the rigid format. Over the course of the blog I published [two paper chapbooks]({% link pages/books.md %}) compiling my favorite posts.

**Fjord Audio.** Also in 2018, I started an audio products company that made cotton-covered microphone cables (in collaboration with Conway Electric), and ran a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spencertweedy/fjord-xlr-classic-microphone-cables). The [promo video](https://youtu.be/cpdUxP-FnNs?si=mZvrXYjqqS52u6YL) featured my grandpa Peter. I delivered all the purchased cables, but didn’t have the will to market it much beyond that (selling fancy cables felt like selling sugar water—just not something anyone really needs), so I shut it down. But there’s still at least one audio electronics project I’d love to work on.

**Avrom Farm Party.** Since 2018, I’ve co-produced a [festival](https://avromfarmparty.com/) with my friend and longtime bandmate Hayden Holbert along with other Chicago artists on Hayden’s family’s farm in Green Lake, Wisconsin. Hayden’s grandpa, Lester Schwartz, was a celebrated painter and sculptor. Many of his works still adorn the farm.

**Buck Tees.** In high school, I started a graphic tee company with a classmate. We sold about a hundred shirts to friends and people online, and then lost steam.

**Chicago Service Relief.** During lockdown, I was overwhelmed by the amount of fundraisers for bars and restaurants and their staff. I thought we might be less overwhelmed, and more likely to actually donate, if there were a directory of fundraisers. I compiled [Chicago Service Relief](https://chicagoservicerelief.com/) and open-sourced the code. A few people in other cities adapted it for their own communities.

**Freelance web design.** Very occasionally, once every blue moon or whatever’s less frequent than that, I’ve done web design and development for friends’ nonprofits, their record labels, or (once upon a time) the Pixel Union Tumblr theme market.

**Spoon’s General Store.** In 2022 I ran an experiment in online… retailing? Some remnants of my great-grandfather’s, great-uncles’, and grandfather’s DNA are in me, calling me to try to curate and sell cool things. (They ran a department store in downtown Chicago in the mid-twentieth century.) In this case, “cool things” was a line of custom hats, t-shirts, photographic prints, and honey made by Chicago bees, centered on the theme “Plant Something.” It was a fun creative project, but I lacked the will and skill to market it effectively enough, so I shut it down. The coolest part was that 500 people signed up for the store’s mailing list when I teased it on Instagram.

**Macatron.** When I was a tiny child I tried to distribute Mac “apps” under the name Macatron. They weren’t really apps; they were packaged scripts that would do little things like turn off translucency for the menubar or whatever else was available in the OS.
