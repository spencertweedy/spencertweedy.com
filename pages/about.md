I’m a drummer and a writer in Chicago.

I love to [make records]({% link pages/releases/releases.html %}) with my friends and family.

I also love writing. I’ve written a few [books]({% link pages/books.md %}). And you can <a href="https://spencertweedy.substack.com" target="_blank">subscribe to my newsletter</a>.

Here’s how to <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">contact me</a>.
