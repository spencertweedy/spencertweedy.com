I’m a drummer and a writer in Chicago. Some people call me Spoon. Here are some [records]({% link pages/releases/releases.html %}) I’ve helped make. I love to [tour]({% link pages/shows/shows.html %}). I co-own a studio in Chicago, [The Pocket](https://pocketchicago.com/), and I co-run a festival, [Avrom Farm Party](https://avromfarmparty.com/). In 2020, I co-created [*Mirror Sound*]({% link pages/mirror-sound.html %}), a book about musicians who self-record.
