I’m a drummer and a writer in Chicago.

I make [music]({% link pages/releases/releases.html %}) with my family, my friends, and strangers who ask.

I co-own [The Pocket](https://pocketchicago.com/), a recording studio, with Jason Ashworth.

I co-organize a small music festival, [Avrom Farm Party](https://avromfarmparty.com/).

I co-created [*Mirror Sound*]({% link pages/mirror-sound.html %}), a book about musicians who self-record.

Some people call me Spoon.

You can listen to [50 songs I dram](https://lnkfi.re/50dram).

Or [subscribe to my newsletter]({{ site.subscribe_url }}).
