<p>Gradually improving this website is like a <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/">worry stone</a>. I come back to it when I want to soothe myself with something comprehensible, puzzle-like, and expressive.</p>
<p>I develop it “by hand” because it’s fun and because I want the cottage industry of the web to continue. The commercial internet has consolidated so much influence in the hands of so few. With open-source tools, small-tech businesses, and personal websites, we can foster more constructive applications of the internet.</p>
<p>My website’s underlying code and more information about the technologies it uses are on <a href="https://github.com/spencertweedy/spencertweedy.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The typesetting is in flux. Right now the site is set in Times New Roman, your browser’s default sans-serif font, and <a href="https://www.scribbletone.com/typefaces/iso">ISO</a> by Scribble Tone. The drum icon is by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/icon/drum-135575/">Arthur Shlain</a> via The Noun Project.</p>
<p><a href="{% link pages/i-like.html %}">Many people</a> have inspired and informed me on this journey of homegrown website cooking, which I began as a teen in the late aughts.</p>
