> “Our current boom of species diversity is newish. We haven’t always had so many different kinds of life, and in the past, the world has looked really different. It changes and shifts. We are having a huge impact on the earth but other species have before and others will again. I find calm and acceptance in that feeling of being along for the ride.”
