**Two opposing systems**

…for avoiding uncertainty about the way the world works and everyone in it.

System 1: Everything is where it’s supposed to be. The government is flawed but it works basically the way anyone should want it to. Justice generally prevails. The best stuff rises to the top. There are good reasons behind things we find frustrating, inefficient, and unjust. Powerful people are trying their best. I’m fortunate because I work hard.

System 2: Everything is fucked and everything would be better if we were in charge. We are artists and poets. We are “philosopher kings.” We are doves, we’re well-read, and our intuition leads us effortlessly to what’s good and right. Greed and cruelty are the only causes of injustice. If you rip the head off the greed monster, and put an anarchic committee of me and my friends in its place, upside-down world would turn right-side up. Everyone would have what they need. And everyone would know we were right all along.

I don’t endorse either of these systems.
