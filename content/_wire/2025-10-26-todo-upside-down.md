I realized my to-do list was upside-down.

I had admin work at the top, daily routines in the middle, and creative hunches/dreams/plans at the bottom.

The first list keeps your house running, the second list keeps your hair from catching fire, and the last list gets you up in the morning. Why would the list that gets you up in the morning be last?
