> The Israelis came to Lydda and forced us to flee. It is a picture that does not leave my mind … Thirty-thousand people walking, crying, screaming with terror … If you see such things your mind and heart alter … Humans must change the world, they must do something, they must kill if needs be. To kill, even if that means we in our turn become inhuman.

*Even if it means we become inhuman.*

That’s George Habash, founder of the PFLP, quoted in Yezid Sayigh’s *Armed Struggle and the Search for State*.

I’m not including it here because I agree with the sentiment or any particular use of force. I’m including it because he acknowledges that to resist or reprise violence robs oneself of one’s own humanity.
