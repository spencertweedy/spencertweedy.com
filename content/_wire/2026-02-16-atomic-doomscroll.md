> I’m left wondering what’s worse: a world with a dozen loud atomic explosions, or one suffused with the quietude of doomscrolling until death (and all the attendant second-order consequences of such; the loss of meaning and a rise of fascism being, to me, clearly one of them).

Heretical (to say the least) to suggest doomscrolling could be as bad for humanity as having our flesh melted off en masse, but still, this gets at the seriousness of concern about the way we’re living. So many of us not only alternately pacify and enrage ourselves all day but also fill our minds up with baseless non-facts/falsities and opinions thrown together by people we wouldn’t trust if they were speaking right in front of us.

I tend to innately think that we’ll be ok, because we’ve been hysterical about every mass media explosion before (books! were once considered a corrupter of the mind), and yet, *it’s finally different this time*, etc.
