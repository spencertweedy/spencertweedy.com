> Mid-walk, entering “the zone,” on day seven, I arrived to Karuizawa in a state of extreme beatificity. Just felt _good_. … If the creator itself came down from the sky at the end of a big walking and photographing and writing day and asked: Did ya do all ya could today? I’d be able to answer, without hesitation, heck yes. I suspect we’re “programmed” to feel good about this … I’d go so far to say that “full days” is one of the wells from which we derive our humanity.
