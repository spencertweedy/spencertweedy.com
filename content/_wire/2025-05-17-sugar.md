This is interesting. I haven’t cross-checked any of the studies. And it occurs to me that the big thing Bronwen doesn’t really mention is that sugar is still a very dense food, so if you’re trying not to put too much energy in your body (calories), sugar can make it more difficult to do that. But I may have to admit to myself that it’s not “poisonous.”

Even in my twenties I’ve felt like my joints hurt after I’ve eaten a medium-to-large amount of sugar. Maybe it was placebo.
