> When I throw a ballot seven thousand miles “home,” when I chuck it in the belly of a metal bird and burn a bit of oil to get it back in a timely way, to be present on that fetid ledger of nightmares, I’m doing so in a vote for [this train hobbyist] — for giving as many people the chance to commit their life to amplifying something positive, however goddamned nutty that thing may be. … Does it dent the universe constructively? Is it additive? Does it, uh, “spark joy” and leave people feeling elevated? Does it erase paranoia and suspicion and insidious stupidity? Does it upend gelded stasis? Does it negate pathological tendencies useful 20,000 years ago when we were resource constrained and living in caves and would die from stubbing a toe? Yes? Then go. Go all in. Do it. Anything that shows us the weird, beautiful, fractal depths of that which we’re capable when we commit to play.
