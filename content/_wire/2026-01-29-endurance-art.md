To state the obvious: relationships are an endurance activity. (I wanna say “sport” but they’re not a sport. More like an art.)

It should be easy, but also you should work at living well together.

When you’re young and you have a sleepover, you usually want to run away from your friend by the end of it. You’ve driven each other crazy.

Heading in to a million spousal sleepovers in a row (if we’re lucky), wanting to run away from each other isn’t an tolerable outcome, so we give each other space, maintain our patience, and, I dunno, prime our minds for extended enjoyable cohabitation.
