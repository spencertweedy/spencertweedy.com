title: Drawers conceal
---

I think I heard Adam Savage say it first: drawers conceal, they put all your tools and docs and whatever out of sight and out of mind. Over and over, I learn this lesson with to-dos: if I actually want to remember to do something, I can’t have a highly detailed filing system. I can’t break lists into categories and folders. They just get lost in there. It’s gotta be flat, obvious, easy to reach, like Adam’s [tool carts](https://youtu.be/TWQAYfGxsPE?si=KKTTZFvm9a4fqQXR). (Embodying reminders in the spaces where they’re relevant, with Post-Its or whatever, is useful, too.)
