Del Toro’s _Frankenstein_:

> “The hunter did not hate the wolf. The wolf did not hate the sheep. But violence felt inevitable between them.” (The Creature)

> “Forgive. Forget. The true measure of wisdom. To know you have been harmed, by whom you have been harmed, and choose to let it all fade.” (The Blind Man)
