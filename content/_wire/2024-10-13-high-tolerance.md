Wall Street Journal:

> The Beirut strike replicated one key aspect of the war in Gaza: Israel’s willingness to use large bombs to achieve its military aims including the targeting of senior leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, even in urban areas where those strikes risk killing many civilians. …
> 
> Israel takes on a far higher risk of civilian casualties than in comparable American attacks on high-value targets, said former U.S. military officials. For example, raids that killed Osama bin Laden and the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, were carried out by teams of special forces on the ground paired with close air support, rather than airstrikes.
> 
> “They have a high tolerance for extreme amounts of civilian casualties, especially when it comes to high-value targets like the Hezbollah leadership or the Hamas leadership,” said Wes Bryant, a retired master sergeant and special operations joint terminal attack controller in the U.S. Air Force.

This is the *Wall Street Journal*, folks. Not a dovish rag.
