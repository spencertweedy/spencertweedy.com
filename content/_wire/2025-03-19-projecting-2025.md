Quotes from my friend Lyn’s essay “[Projecting 2025](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H_SxEZ6nqEuqw0sy5QUS83yEUJynfookOXjTeq-nHN4/edit?usp=sharing)”:

- “Since the 1960s, food prices have risen fourfold, but median rent in the U.S. has risen *more than* *sixteen-fold*.”
- “It is estimated that 140 million people in America (43% of the population) cannot afford the basic necessities of life where they live.”
- “Ideological impurity and systemic power are two different things. Put bluntly—you can be wrong about a lot of things AND be pretty powerless.”
- “The people at the bottom, ‘the voice from below,’ includes *everyone*.”
