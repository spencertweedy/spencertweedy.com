I﻿ learned the other day that part of the American Revolutionary War was fought on the island of Manhattan. And [the house](https://morrisjumel.org/stories/history-of-the-house/) from which George Washington directed the Continental Army during that battle still stands in what’s now New York City.

There’s a spot on the campus of Columbia University where Thomas Knowlton, a Revolutionary colonel, was killed.
